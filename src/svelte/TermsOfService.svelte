    15. MISCELLANEOUS. You agree that these Terms of Service are not intended to
    confer and do not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than
    the parties to this agreement. You also understand and agree that the
    Relm.us Terms of Service and the Relm.us Privacy Policy, including Relm.us's
    enforcement of those policies, are not intended to confer, and do not
    confer, any rights or remedies upon any person. If any part of this
    agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed
    in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as
    possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions
    shall remain in full force and effect. Relm.us may assign its rights or
    delegate its obligations under this agreement without your prior written
    consent, as long as the assignee expressly assumes in writing the
    performance of all of the terms of this agreement. This agreement shall not
    be construed to create a joint venture or partnership between the parties.
    Neither party shall be deemed to be an employee, agent, partner nor legal
    representative of the other for any purpose and neither shall have any
    right, power or authority to create any obligation or responsibility on
    behalf of the other. The failure of Relm.us at any time or times to require
    performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right at a
    later time to enforce the same. No waiver by Relm.us of the breach of any
    term or covenant contained in this agreement, whether by conduct or
    otherwise, in anyone or more instances, shall be deemed to be, or construed
    as, a further or continuing waiver of any such breach or a waiver of the
    breach of any other term or covenant contained in this agreement. The laws
    of the State of New Hampshire govern this agreement and your membership. As
    noted above, player/member conduct may be subject to other local, state,
    national and international laws. You expressly agree that exclusive
    jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with Relm.us, Relm.US Inc. or relating
    in any way to your membership or your use of Relm.us's services resides in
    the courts of New Hampshire and you further agree and expressly consent to
    the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of New Hampshire in
    connection with any such dispute including any claim involving Relm.us,
    Relm.US Inc. or its affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, contractors,
    officers, members/managers, vendors and content providers.
